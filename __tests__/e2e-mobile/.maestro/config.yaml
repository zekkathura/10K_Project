# 01-smoke-test.yaml        - Quick health check (~30s)
# 02-full-user-journey.yaml - Complete game lifecycle (~3-4min)
# 03-settings-and-theme.yaml - Settings and theme toggle (~1min)
# 04-edge-cases.yaml        - Error handling tests (~1min)
#
# Total run time: ~6 minutes (vs 10+ minutes with old tests)
