    <h3>Error and Diagnostic Data</h3>
    <p>To improve app stability, we automatically collect:</p>

        <li><strong>Platform</strong> - Android, iOS, or web</li>
        <li><strong>Screen context</strong> - Which screen the error occurred on</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This data is sanitized to remove any personal information (emails, IDs, etc.) before being stored. Error logs are only accessible to developers and are used solely to identify and fix bugs.</p>

    <h2>How We Use Your Information</h2>

        <li>To diagnose and fix app errors (using anonymized error data)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Data Storage and Security</h2>
    <p>Your data is stored securely using <a href="https://supabase.com" target="_blank">Supabase</a>, a secure cloud database platform. We implement industry-standard security measures including:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Use advertising identifiers (IDFA/GAID)</li>
        <li>Share data with advertising networks</li>
        <li>Track your activity outside of our app</li>
        <li>Build profiles for targeted advertising</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The only analytics we collect are anonymized error logs to fix bugs (see "Error and Diagnostic Data" above).</p>

    </ul>
    <p><strong>Error logs</strong> are retained for up to 30 days for debugging purposes, then automatically deleted.</p>
